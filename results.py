def calculate_opponent_uniqueness(df):
    """
    Calculates the percentage of unique opponents each car has raced against,
    relative to the total number of possible opponents in the dataset.

    This metric is useful for evaluating fairness and diversity in race
    scheduling—higher percentages indicate a car has been matched against a
    broader range of competitors.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    df : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing at least the following columns:
        - "Car": Car identifier
        - "Heat": Heat number each car participated in

    Returns:
    -------
    pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame with the following columns:
        - "Car": Car identifier (as a string)
        - "Opponent_Uniqueness_Pct": Percentage (0–100) representing how many unique
          competitors this car has faced, relative to the total possible opponents.

        Example:
        ----------
        +------+--------------------------+
        | Car  | Opponent_Uniqueness_Pct |
        +------+--------------------------+
        | 101  | 87.5                     |
        | 102  | 62.5                     |
        +------+--------------------------+

    Calculation:
    ------------
    For each car:
        - Find all heats the car appears in.
        - Collect all other cars that appear in those heats.
        - Compare that set to the total possible opponents (all cars minus itself).
        - Compute the percentage of unique opponents faced.

    Notes:
    ------
    - Car identifiers are cast to strings to ensure consistency.
    - If a car has no possible opponents (i.e. it’s the only car), it receives 0%.
    - Ideal for use in fairness audits or schedule diagnostics after heat generation.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> calculate_opponent_uniqueness(df)
       Car  Opponent_Uniqueness_Pct
    0  101                     85.7

    Updates the 'Racers' sheet in the Excel workbook with performance summary data,
    including total points, heat count, first-place finishes, and overall rank.

    This function merges computed race summary statistics into the main "Racers" sheet,
    ensuring all relevant results are attached to each car, and then sorts the data for
    readability and reporting.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    path : str
        The full file path to the Excel workbook.

    summary_data : pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing summarized race results for each car.
        Expected columns:
            - "Car" (string/int): Unique car identifier
            - "Total_Points" (numeric): Sum of points earned by the car
            - "First_Place_Count" (int): Number of first-place finishes
            - "Rank" (int): Final ranking based on performance

    Behavior:
    ---------
    - Reads the existing "Racers" sheet and ensures car identifiers are treated as strings.
    - Drops any existing columns that may conflict with the new summary data:
        - "Total_Points", "First_Place_Count", "Rank"
    - Merges the summary data into the sheet by matching on "Car".
    - Sorts the resulting sheet by "Class", "Group", and "Rank" for organized viewing.
    - Rewrites the updated DataFrame back to the "Racers" sheet, replacing the original.

    Error Handling:
    ---------------
    - If any step fails (reading, merging, writing), an error message is printed.
    - No exception is raised; failure is logged for diagnostics.

    Dependencies:
    -------------
    - `read_excel_sheet(path, sheet_name)`: Reads a sheet into a DataFrame.
    - Uses `pandas.ExcelWriter` with `openpyxl` to overwrite the sheet in-place.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> update_racers_tab("results.xlsx", summary_df)
    [OK] Racers sheet updated and sorted by Class, Group, Rank.

    Notes:
    ------
    - Assumes the "Racers" sheet includes at least a "Car" column, and optionally
      "Class" and "Group" for sorting.
    - This is typically called after final standings are computed across all heats.

    Processes all heat sheets in a race workbook to calculate standings,

    heat data, computes total points and other stats for each car, detects tie
    scenarios, writes new ranking sheets per group, and updates the main
    "Racers" tab with combined results.

    Parameters:

    file_path : str
        Full path to the Excel file containing race heat results and a "Racers" sheet.

    - For each valid heat sheet:
        - Filters out rows with missing or non-numeric placement values

            - Total Points (sum of places)

            - Heat Count
            - Opponent Uniqueness %

        - Writes rankings to a new sheet named "{Group}_Rankings"
    - Merges all group summaries into a single DataFrame and updates the "Racers" tab.

    Outputs:
    --------
    - One new sheet per group with rankings and summary stats

    Adds a "Runoff" sheet to the Excel workbook if any group contains a tie

    This function scans all *_Rankings sheets for tied placements in the top 3
    (ranks 1, 2, or 3). If any ties are found, it creates a new "Runoff" sheet
    listing those cars, along with their identifying information, to be used
    for organizing tiebreaker races.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    file_path : str
        Path to the Excel workbook containing heat results, rankings, and racer info.

    Behavior:
    ---------
    - Loads all sheets from the workbook into memory.
    - Checks if a "Racers" sheet exists; if not, exits early.
    - Iterates through all sheets ending in "_Rankings".
        - For each, checks the "Rank" column for duplicates among the top 3.
        - If duplicates are found, merges in metadata from the "Racers" sheet
          and stores a row for each tied racer.
    - If any ties are found:
        - Creates or replaces a sheet called "Runoff".
        - Writes all qualifying rows to it, sorted by Class, Group, Rank, Name.

    Returns:
    --------

    Output:
    -------
    - A "Runoff" tab containing cars that need tiebreaker races.
    - Console messages indicating success, failure, or if no action is needed.

    Sheet Columns:
    --------------
    The "Runoff" sheet will contain the following columns:
    - Car
    - Name
    - Class
    - Group
    - Description
    - LastRank (the tied rank from the original ranking sheet)

    - `dataframe_to_rows()` — converts DataFrame to row data for Excel writing.
    - `openpyxl.load_workbook()` — used for editing the Excel workbook directly.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If the "Runoff" sheet already exists, it will be replaced.
    - If no top-3 ties are found in any ranking sheet, no tab is created.
    - Ties are identified based on multiple cars sharing the same Rank value
