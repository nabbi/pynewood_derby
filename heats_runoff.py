heats_runoff.py â€” Pinewood Derby Runoff Heat Generator (Round-Robin)

Generates head-to-head runoff heats for tied cars using full round-robin logic.
Reads from a manually created workbook containing only a 'Racers' tab.

Usage:
    python heats_runoff.py <racers_file.xlsx> [num_lanes]

Output:
    Updates the input file with:
    - 'Racers' tab (reused from original)
    - One heat tab per Class/Group (e.g. "Tiger_A")

def _generate_small_group_heats(cars, lane_labels):
    """
    Generate a set of race heats for a small group of cars, where the number
    of cars is less than or equal to the number of available lanes.

    Each car will run exactly once in each lane, with their positions rotating
    between heats to ensure that every car gets an opportunity to race in every lane.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    cars : list
        A list of car identifiers (e.g., numbers or names).

    lane_labels : list
        A list of lane labels (e.g., ["Lane 1", "Lane 2", ...]).
        The function will only use as many lanes as there are cars.

    Returns:
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        A DataFrame representing the scheduled heats. Each row contains:
            - "Heat": the heat number (starting from 1),
            - "Car": the car identifier,
            - "Lane": the lane the car is assigned to in that heat.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If the number of lanes exceeds the number of cars, only the first `len(cars)` lanes are used.
    - Each car rotates through each lane exactly once.

    Example:
    -------

def generate_round_robin_heats(cars, num_lanes):
    """
    Generate a round-robin heat schedule for a group of cars, assigning them to
    available lanes across multiple heats.

    If the number of cars is less than or equal to the number of lanes, each car
    runs once in each lane (handled by a helper function). Otherwise, cars are
    paired off in a round-robin style so that each pair races exactly once.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    cars : list
        A list of car identifiers (e.g., strings or integers).

    num_lanes : int
        Total number of available lanes for each heat.

    Returns:
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        A DataFrame where each row represents a car's participation in a heat.
        Columns include:
            - "Heat": the heat number,
            - "Car": the car identifier,
            - "Lane": the lane assigned for that heat.

    Logic Overview:
    ---------------
    - If the number of cars is small enough, use a fixed rotation where each car
      runs in each lane exactly once.
    - For larger groups, generate all unique car pairings.
    - In each heat:
        - Try to fit as many non-overlapping car pairs as possible, respecting
          the lane limit.
        - Assign each car in that heat to a shuffled lane (for fairness).
    - Continue until all unique pairings have raced at least once.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> generate_round_robin_heats(["C1", "C2", "C3", "C4"], 3)
       Heat Car Lane
    0     1  C1    A

    4     2  C4    A
    5     2  C2    C
    ...

    Notes:
    ------
    - Uses a helper `_generate_small_group_heats` for small groups.
    - Relies on a secure shuffle (assumed from `secure_shuffle()`) for fair and
      randomized lane assignments.
    - If no full pairing can be made in a heat (due to lane limits vs remaining cars),
      an arbitrary leftover pair is forcibly added to ensure all matchups are completed.

def process_class_group(writer, cls, grp, group_df, num_lanes):
    """
    Generate, validate, and export round-robin race heats for a specific class/group of cars.

    This function handles the full pipeline for a race group:
    - Randomly shuffles the list of participating cars.
    - Attempts to generate valid heats using round-robin logic (with a retry loop).
    - Validates the generated heats to ensure all rules are satisfied.
    - Maps car names and prepares final race sheet formatting.
    - Writes the result to a sheet in the provided Excel writer.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    writer : pandas.ExcelWriter
        An Excel writer instance used to output the resulting heats to a spreadsheet.

    cls : str
        The name of the class/category this group belongs to (used in sheet naming and logs).

    grp : str
        The name/identifier of the group within the class (used in sheet naming and logs).

    group_df : pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame containing car data for the class/group. Expected columns:
        - "Car" (required): Unique car identifiers.
        - "Name" (optional): Optional human-readable names for the cars.

    num_lanes : int
        The number of lanes available on the track. This affects heat generation logic.

    Behavior:
    --------
    - If fewer than 2 cars are present, the group is skipped with a log message.
    - For valid groups, it tries up to 200 times to generate heats that pass validation.
    - The heat schedule includes Heat, Car, Name, Lane, and Place columns.
    - Small groups (cars <= lanes) use `_generate_small_group_heats`, larger groups use pairing logic.
    - Final output is sorted by heat and lane and written to an Excel sheet with a sanitized name.

    Sheet Naming:
    -------------
    The output sheet is named based on the class and group, e.g., "Stock_A" or "Open_General".

    Example:
    --------
    >>> process_class_group(writer, "Stock", "A", group_df, 4)
    [INFO] Generating round-robin heats for: Class 'Stock' / Group 'A'
    [INFO] Using standard heat logic
    [OK] Heats written to sheet: Stock_A

    Notes:
    ------
    - Depends on helper functions: `secure_shuffle`, `generate_round_robin_heats`,
      `validate_runoff_heats`, and `sanitize_sheet_title`.
    - Validation ensures no duplicate lanes or cars, complete matchups, and correct heat counts.
